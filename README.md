# Pet Management System

This project is an automated pet management system that allows users to control feeding, watering, playing music, and dispensing medicine for their pets using voice commands. It integrates hardware components like a servo motor for food dispensing, a motor for water, and LEDs for status indication.

## Features

- **Voice Command Control**: Use voice commands to operate the system.
- **Automated Feeding**: Schedule daily feeding at a specified time.
- **Water Dispensing**: Dispense water for your pet on command.
- **Calm Music Playback**: Play calming music to soothe your pet.
- **Medicine Dispensing**: Dispense medication as needed.
- **Error Handling**: The system handles errors gracefully during operations.

## Hardware Components

- **Servo Motor** (for food dispensing)
- **DC Motor** (for water dispensing)
- **LED** (to indicate music mode)
- **DC Motor** (for medicine dispensing)
- **Microphone** (for voice recognition)

## Software Requirements
